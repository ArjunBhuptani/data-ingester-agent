## Everclear Protocol Q3 2024 Update

The Everclear Protocol Q3 2024 Update provides a comprehensive overview of the developments and achievements of the Everclear Protocol and its ecosystem, a collaborative effort between the Connext Foundation and Proxima Labs. The update highlights significant team expansion, including the hiring of senior leadership in Product, Operations, and Business Development, along with key consultants in product and marketing, and additional engineering members from Labs. A major focus of the quarter was the preparation for the launch of the protocol's Mainnet Beta, which involved securing DeFi partnerships for building a vibrant marketplace for cross-chain clearing and expanding the xERC20 interop token standard to increase cross-chain volume flows. The update also covers token initiatives, such as amending the token unlock schedule, collaborating with Vending-Machine for a vote-bonding system tailored for Everclear's clearing protocol, and the successful announcement of Mainnet Beta at Token2049, which has since crossed 1M in clearing volume. Additionally, it mentions the sunsetting of Amarok (Connext Bridge) as part of a strategic shift away from the retail-oriented bridge.

## Everclear Protocol

The Everclear protocol is designed as a pioneering Clearing Layer aimed at coordinating the global settlement of liquidity across different blockchain networks, thereby addressing the issue of modular fragmentation. It introduces a novel approach to enhance interoperability and efficiency in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by facilitating seamless transactions between various chains without the need for users to manage or even be aware of the underlying blockchain infrastructure. This initiative is supported by a series of strategic hires, partnerships, and growth initiatives, including the integration of new team members with expertise from notable companies in the crypto space, forming significant partnerships with entities across the DeFi and centralized finance (CeFi) landscapes, and launching a mainnet beta that garnered significant attention. Additionally, Everclear is focusing on governance and security enhancements through the introduction of a Governance Task Force and a Security Council, alongside plans for technological advancements in UI/UX, API functionality, and analytics to optimize its protocol's fee structure. The protocol's roadmap also includes expanding its ecosystem through more integrations and launching a vote-bonding tokenomics model.

## Clearing Layers

Clearing Layers are a new blockchain infrastructure concept designed to facilitate the global settlement of liquidity across different blockchain networks, thereby solving the issue of modular fragmentation. They operate by coordinating market actors to net flows of funds between chains before ultimately settling with the underlying chains and bridges. This mechanism allows for seamless liquidity and permissionless chain expansion for protocols that build on them. Everclear is introduced as the first Clearing Layer, which is currently live on testnet. It aims to reduce the cost and complexity of rebalancing liquidity between chains by offering transactions with less than 5 basis points (bps) in fees. Everclear is built as an Arbitrum Orbit rollup, utilizing Gelato RaaS for rollup operations, and connects to other chains through Hyperlane with an Eigenlayer Interchain Security Module (ISM).
